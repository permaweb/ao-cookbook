# AO and the AO Cookbook

> AO is a decentralized compute system that enables countless parallel processes to interact within a single, cohesive environment. The AO Cookbook provides comprehensive documentation and code snippets for developers, focusing on AOS (AO Operating System) integration and development patterns. This documentation is designed to be both human-readable and LLM-friendly, offering detailed context about AO's architecture, components, and development practices.

## System Architecture

- AO Core: The foundational decentralized computer with infinite parallel threads
- AOS: The operating system layer that simplifies interaction with AO
- Message-Passing Layer: Native communication system connecting independent processes
- Execution Model: Hyper-parallel architecture similar to how websites form the World Wide Web
- Primary Language: Lua with AOS runtime environment

## Network Information

- **AO Mainnet** (Launched February 8, 2025)
  - Production environment with full features
  - Introduces AO Core capabilities
  - Enables onchain computation with payments and relays
  - Accessible through HyperBEAM nodes serving as payment gateways
  - Supports production deployments and live applications

- **AO Legacynet** (Launched February 27, 2024)
  - Provides a fee-free environment for early adopters
  - Perfect for experimenting with AO's hyper-parallel architecture
  - Full feature support for development and testing
  - Ideal for learning and prototyping
  - No cost barrier for developers
