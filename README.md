# ao Cookbook

The ao Cookbook is meant to house small digestible code snippets
for someone that has no experience with ao to be able
to grab and go.

## Contributing

The Cookbook is welcome to any and all contributions. Please refer to
the project's style when contributing new snippets of code.

### Structure

Currently we have "sections" under `/src` and the code for those sections.

| Section         | Description                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Getting Started | Resources for starting development on ao                    |
| Core Concepts   | Building blocks of ao that are good to know for development |
| Guides          | Snack-sized guides about different tools for development    |
| References      | References to commonly needed code snippets                 |

#### Writing References

References are an overarching topic with a list of references of how to do
things under that topic. The general structure is the following:

```
Code Reference Title

Short Summary

Code Snippet
```

### Writing Guides

Guides are longer form informational documentation on various topics.
The general structure for writing a guide is the following:

```
Brief Summary/TLDR

Fact Sheet

Deep Dive

Other Resources
```

### Building

> If you use GitPod, this setup is done for you.

You need to have node v18 installed - https://nodejs.org

```sh
cd docs
yarn
yarn dev
```
