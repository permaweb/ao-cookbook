# 0rbit ðŸ’«

[0rbit](https://0rbit.co/) **decentralised, permissionless and censorship-resistant** oracle network built on top of Arweave using `ao`.

0rbit is built on the `ao` computer, which enables access to **ANY Data** present on the web through the Arweave network.

0rbit provides the following features to get access to the data using the HTTP protocol:

- [**Fetch HTTP Data**](https://docs.0rbit.co/fetch-http-data): A handler to fetch any data from the the web _into your `ao` process._
- [**Post HTTP Data**](https://docs.0rbit.co/fetch-http-data): A handler to post any data _from the `ao` process_ to the web.
