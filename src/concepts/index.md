# Concepts

This section explains the core concepts and architecture behind AO, helping you understand how the system works at a fundamental level.

## System Architecture

AO is built on a few fundamental principles that form its foundation:

- **Two core types**: Messages and Processes - the basic building blocks of the AO ecosystem
- **No shared state, only Holographic State** - a unique approach to distributed computing
- **Decentralized Computer (Grid)** - enabling truly distributed applications

## Core Components

Explore these foundational concepts to gain a deeper understanding of AO:

- [How it Works](how-it-works) - An overview of AO's architecture and how the different parts interact
- [Processes](processes) - Learn about processes, the computational units in AO
- [Messages](messages) - Understand the messaging system that enables communication
- [Evaluation](eval) - Discover how code execution works in the AO environment
- [Units](units) - Learn about the computational units that power the AO network

## Technical Foundations

- [Specifications](specs) - Detailed technical specifications for the AO protocol

## Getting Started

- [Meet Lua](lua) - Introduction to Lua, the programming language used in AO
- [AO System Tour](tour) - A guided tour of the AO system and its capabilities
