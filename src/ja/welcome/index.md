The ao computer is a world where countless parallel processes interact within a single, cohesive computing environment, seamlessly interlinked through a native message-passing layer. It is a burgeoning ecosystem of decentralized programs, akin to the World Wide Web, where each process, like a website, operates independently yet is intricately woven into a unified experience.

## ao + aos: The rocket and your rocket fuel.

Typically when you use ao, you will interact with it through its operating system: `aos`.

aos is an abstraction layer that runs in your processes, making it easy to use the full functionality of the ao computer. In this cookbook, you will learn everything you need to know about getting started with the ao computer using aos.

## Paper

If you would like to learn more about the technical specifications of ao, please check out its [spec](https://ao.g8way.io/#/read) for detailed analysis.

## Next Steps

In the tutorials that follow, we will explore ao and build everything from chatrooms to autonomous, decentralized bots.

Let's jump into it! 🚀
