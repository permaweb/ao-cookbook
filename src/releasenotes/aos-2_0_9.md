## Changes in this Release

- **Deduplication Feature Reverted**: This release reverts the previously introduced deduplication feature.

- **Hyper AOS Improvements**: Added working integration with `https://forward.computer` for Hyper AOS.

## Using Hyper AOS with forward.computer

You can now connect to and interact with forward.computer through the Hyper AOS integration. This provides additional capabilities while maintaining the experimental nature of the feature.

```shell
aos --url http://forward.computer
```

Then select the hyper-aos option when prompted.

> **Note**: The Hyper AOS functionality remains experimental. Use with caution and it's not recommended for production environments. If you encounter any issues, please report them to help us improve the integration in future releases.
