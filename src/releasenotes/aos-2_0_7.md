# Hyper AOS v2.0.7

## Installation and Setup

This release of Hyper AOS adds support for the latest HyperBEAM changes (edge) while providing full backwards compatibility with aos legacynet. The latest version can be installed globally using npm:

```bash
npm i -g https://get_ao.arweave.net
```

## Connecting to Hyper AOS

To connect to a local Hyper AOS instance:

```bash
aos --url http://localhost:8734
```

Select `hyper-aos`:

```
Welcome to AOS: Your operating system for AO, the decentralized open access supercomputer.
Type ".load-blueprint chat" to join the community chat and ask questions!
? Please select › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    aos
❯   hyper-aos (experimental - DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION)
```

Once connected, you can load blueprints:

```
> .load-blueprint htoken
```

## API Differences from Standard AOS

Hyper AOS has several syntax differences compared to the standard AOS:

- Use `id` instead of `ao.id`
- Use `owner` instead of `Owner`
- For sending messages, use `send({target = id, data = "Hello"})` instead of `ao.send` or `Send`
- Coroutines and `os.receive()` / `Receive()` are not implemented

## State Synchronization

One of the most powerful features of Hyper AOS is the synchronization between Hyperbeam process state and Lua state:

```lua
-- In Lua:
Foo = "BAR"

-- In Hyperbeam:
-- http://localhost:8734/{process}/now/Foo
-- Returns 'BAR'
```

## Best Practices

### Variable Scoping

When requiring modules, it's recommended to use local variables to prevent memory leaks and improve garbage collection:

```lua
-- Good practice
local JSON = require('json')
-- Use JSON...

-- Better practice for memory management
do
  local JSON = require('json')
  -- Use JSON...
end
```

### Known Issues

There are some serialization bugs to be aware of:

- If you set a global variable to a required module, you may lose methods during serialization:

```lua
-- Problematic approach
JSON = require('json')
-- You might lose access to encode/decode methods

-- Recommended approach
local JSON = require('json')
-- Methods remain accessible
```

## Performance

The system is optimized for speed, making it suitable for applications requiring quick response times.
