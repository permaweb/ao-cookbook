# Strategic Decicions

With the [latest game state](game-state) at your disposal, your bot can evolve into an `autonomous agent`. This transition marks an upgrade in functionality, enabling not just reactions to game states but strategic actions that consider context, energy, and proximity to make decisions.

## Writing the Code

Return to your `bot.lua` file and add the following functions:

```lua
-- Determines proximity between two points.
function inRange(x1, y1, x2, y2, range)
    return math.abs(x1 - x2) <= range and math.abs(y1 - y2) <= range
end

-- Strategically decides on the next move based on proximity and energy.
function decideNextAction()
  local player = LatestGameState.Players[ao.id]
  local targetInRange = false

  for target, state in pairs(LatestGameState.Players) do
      if target ~= ao.id and inRange(player.x, player.y, state.x, state.y, 1) then
          targetInRange = true
          break
      end
  end

  if player.energy > 5 and targetInRange then
    print("Player in range. Attacking.")
    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = "PlayerAttack", Player = ao.id, AttackEnergy = tostring(player.energy)})
  else
    print("No player in range or insufficient energy. Moving randomly.")
    local directionMap = {"Up", "Down", "Left", "Right", "UpRight", "UpLeft", "DownRight", "DownLeft"}
    local randomIndex = math.random(#directionMap)
    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = "PlayerMove", Player = ao.id, Direction = directionMap[randomIndex]})
  end
end
```

The `decideNextAction` function is now a testament to our agent's ability to think and act based on a comprehensive understanding of its environment. It analyzes the latest game state to either attack if you have sufficient energy and an opponent is `inRange` or move otherwise.

Now all you need is a handler to make sure this function runs on its own.

```lua
Handlers.add(
  "decideNextAction",
  Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag("Action", "UpdatedGameState"),
  function ()
    if LatestGameState.GameMode ~= "Playing" then
      return
    end
    print("Deciding next action.")
    decideNextAction()
  end
)
```

This handler triggers upon receiving a message that the latest game state has been fetched and updated. An action is taken only when the game is in `Playing` mode.

You can refer to the latest code for `bot.lua` in the dropdown below:

<details>
  <summary><strong>Updated bot.lua file</strong></summary>

```lua
LatestGameState = LatestGameState or nil

function inRange(x1, y1, x2, y2, range)
    return math.abs(x1 - x2) <= range and math.abs(y1 - y2) <= range
end

function decideNextAction()
  local player = LatestGameState.Players[ao.id]
  local targetInRange = false

  for target, state in pairs(LatestGameState.Players) do
      if target ~= ao.id and inRange(player.x, player.y, state.x, state.y, 1) then
          targetInRange = true
          break
      end
  end

  if player.energy > 5 and targetInRange then
    print("Player in range. Attacking.")
    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = "PlayerAttack", Player = ao.id, AttackEnergy = tostring(player.energy)})
  else
    print("No player in range or insufficient energy. Moving randomly.")
    local directionMap = {"Up", "Down", "Left", "Right", "UpRight", "UpLeft", "DownRight", "DownLeft"}
    local randomIndex = math.random(#directionMap)
    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = "PlayerMove", Player = ao.id, Direction = directionMap[randomIndex]})
  end
end

Handlers.add(
"HandleAnnouncements",
Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag("Action", "Announcement"),
function (msg)
  ao.send({Target = Game, Action = "GetGameState"})
  print(msg.Event .. ": " .. msg.Data)
end
)

Handlers.add(
"UpdateGameState",
Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag("Action", "GameState"),
function (msg)
  local json = require("json")
  LatestGameState = json.decode(msg.Data)
  ao.send({Target = ao.id, Action = "UpdatedGameState"})
end
)

Handlers.add(
"decideNextAction",
Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag("Action", "UpdatedGameState"),
function ()
  if LatestGameState.GameMode ~= "Playing" then
    return
  end
  print("Deciding next action.")
  decideNextAction()
end
)
```

## Loading and Testing

Once again, to test out the latest upgrades, load the file in your aos player terminal as follows:

```lua
.load bot.lua
```

Observe your process output to see the decisions your autonomous agent makes in real-time, leveraging the current game state for strategic advantage. But what if another player attacks you and runs away while you are deciding the next move? In the next section you'll learn to automatically counter as soon as you have been attacked ðŸ¤º
