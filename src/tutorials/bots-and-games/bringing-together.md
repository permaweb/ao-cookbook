# Bringing it Together

This final guide wraps up our series, where you've built up an autonomous agent piece by piece. Now, let's refine your agent with some optimizations that fine-tune its operations. Here's a quick overview of the key improvements made:

- **Sequential Command Execution:** The introduction of an `InAction` flag ensures that your agent's actions are sequential (next action occurs only when the previous is successfully executed). This critical addition prevents your agent from acting on outdated game states, enhancing its responsiveness and accuracy. The full implementation can be found in the final code for the `bot.lua` file below.

```lua
InAction = InAction or false -- Prevents the agent from taking multiple actions at once.
```

- **Dynamic State Updates and Decisions:** The agent now employs an automatic tick logic, allowing for dynamic updates and decisions. This logic enables the agent to self-trigger state updates and make subsequent decisions either upon receiving a Tick message or upon completing an action, promoting autonomous operation.

```lua
Handlers.add("GetGameStateOnTick", Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag("Action", "Tick"), function ()
  if not InAction then
    InAction = true
    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = "GetGameState"})
  end
end)
```

- **Automated Fee Transfer:** To further streamline its operation and ensure uninterrupted participation in games, the autonomous agent now autonomously handles the transfer of confirmation fees.

```lua
Handlers.add("AutoPay", Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag("Action", "AutoPay"), function ()
  ao.send({Target = Game, Action = "Transfer", Recipient = Game, Quantity = "1000"})
end)
```

In addition to these features, we've also added a logging function for debugging purposes and colored prints for better comprehension of game events. These enhancements collectively make your autonomous agent more efficient and adaptable in the game environment.

Check out the complete bot.lua code in the dropdown below, with all new additions highlighted accordingly:
