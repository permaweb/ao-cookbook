# Mechanics of the Arena

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanics essential for designing and managing arena-style games in `aos`. In arena games, participants engage in rounds, strategically vying to eliminate each other until a sole victor emerges.

The framework presented here lays the groundwork for crafting a wide range of games, all sharing the same core functionalities. Explore the intricacies of game development and unleash your creativity within this versatile arena.

## Core Functionalities

Now, let's dive into the core functionalities that power arena-style games:

1. **Game Progression Modes:**

Arena games are structured into rounds that operate in a loop with the following progression modes: `"Not-Started"` → `"Waiting"` → `"Playing"` → `[Someone wins or timeout]` → `"Waiting"`...

> [!Note]
> The loop timesout if there are not enough players to start a game after the waiting state.

Rounds offer a defined timeframe for players to engage, intensifying the excitement of gameplay.

2. **Token Stakes:**

Players must deposit a specified quantity of tokens (defined by `PaymentQty`) to participate in the game. These tokens add a tangible stake element to the game.

3. **Bonus Rewards:**

Beyond the thrill of victory, players are enticed by the prospect of extra rewards. The builder has the flexibility to offer bonus tokens, defined by `BonusQty`, to be distributed per round. Any bets placed by players are also added to these bonuses. These bonuses serve as an additional incentive, enhancing the competitive spirit of the gameplay.

4. **Player Management:**

- Players waiting to join the next game are tracked in the `Waiting` table.
- Active players and their game states are stored in the `Players` table.
- Eliminated players are promptly removed from the `Players` table and placed in the `Waiting` table for the next game.

5. **Round Winner Reward:**

When a player eliminates another, they earn not only bragging rights but also the eliminated player's deposit tokens as a reward. Additionally, winners of each round share a portion of the bonus tokens, as well as their original stake, further motivating players to strive for victory.

6. **Listener Mode:**

For those who prefer to watch the action unfold, the "Listen" mode offers an opportunity to stay informed without active participation. Processes can register as listeners, granting them access to all announcements from the game. While they do not engage as players, listeners can continue to observe the game's progress unless they explicitly request removal.

7. **Game State Management:**

To maintain the flow and fairness of arena games, an automated system oversees game state transitions. These transitions encompass waiting, playing, and ending phases. Time durations for each state, such as `WaitTime` and `GameTime`, ensure that rounds adhere to defined timeframes, preventing games from lasting indefinitely.

-- ARENA GAME BLUEPRINT.

-- This blueprint provides the framework to operate an 'arena' style game
-- inside an ao process. Games are played in rounds, where players aim to
-- eliminate one another until only one remains, or until the game time
-- has elapsed. The game process will play rounds indefinitely as players join
-- and leave.

-- When a player eliminates another, they receive the eliminated player's deposit token
-- as a reward. Additionally, the builder can provide a bonus of these tokens
-- to be distributed per round as an additional incentive. If the intended
-- player type in the game is a bot, providing an additional 'bonus'
-- creates an opportunity for coders to 'mine' the process's
-- tokens by competing to produce the best agent.

-- The builder can also provide other handlers that allow players to perform
-- actions in the game, calling 'eliminatePlayer()' at the appropriate moment
-- in their game logic to control the framework.

-- Processes can also register in a 'Listen' mode, where they will receive
-- all announcements from the game, but are not considered for entry into the
-- rounds themselves. They are also not unregistered unless they explicitly ask
-- to be.

-- GLOBAL VARIABLES.

-- [Not-Started] -> Waiting -> Playing -> [Someone wins or timeout] -> Waiting...
