# HyperBEAM from AO Connect

This guide explains how to interact with a process using HyperBEAM and `aoconnect`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js environment
- `@permaweb/aoconnect` library
- The latest version of aos
- Wallet file (`wallet.json`) containing your cryptographic keys
- A HyperBEAM node running with the genesis_wasm profile

  ```bash
  rebar3 as genesis_wasm shell
  ```

- The Process ID for a process created with genesis_wasm (this is the default in the latest version of aos).

## Step 1: Environment Setup

Install necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install @permaweb/aoconnect
```

Ensure your wallet file (`wallet.json`) is correctly formatted and placed in your project directory.

You can create a test wallet using this command:
`npx -y @permaweb/wallet > wallet.json`

## Step 2: Establish Connection

Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `index.js`) and set up your Permaweb connection. You will need a `processId` of a process that you want to interact with.

```javascript
import { connect, createSigner } from "@permaweb/aoconnect";
import fs from "node:fs";

const jwk = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("wallet.json", "utf-8"));

// The Process ID to interact with
const processId = "<your genesis_wasm generated process id>";

const { request } = connect({
  MODE: "mainnet",
  URL: "http://localhost:8734",
  signer: createSigner(jwk),
});
```

## Step 3: Pushing a Message to a Process

Use the `request` function to send a message to the process. In `aoconnect`, this is done by using the `push` path parameter.

```javascript
const processResult = await request({
  path: `/${processId}~process@1.0/push/serialize~json@1.0`,
  method: "POST",
  target: processId,
  signingFormat: "ANS-104",
});

console.log(processResult);
```

## Full Example

To run the full script, combine the snippets from Step 2 and 3 into `index.js`:

```javascript
import { connect, createSigner } from "@permaweb/aoconnect";
import fs from "node:fs";

const jwk = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("wallet.json", "utf-8"));

const processId = "<your genesis_wasm generated process id>";

const { request } = connect({
  MODE: "mainnet",
  URL: "http://localhost:8734",
  signer: createSigner(jwk),
});

const processResult = await request({
  path: `/${processId}~process@1.0/push/serialize~json@1.0`,
  method: "POST",
  target: processId,
  signingFormat: "ANS-104",
});

console.log(processResult);
```

Now, run it:

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see an object logged to the console, containing the ID of the message that was sent.

## Conclusion

Following these steps, you've successfully sent a message to a process. This is a fundamental interaction for building applications on hyperAOS.
