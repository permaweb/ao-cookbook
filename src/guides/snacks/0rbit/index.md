# 0rbit ðŸ’«

[0rbit](https://0rbit.co/) is the first-ever Decentralised Oracle Network on Arweave using `ao`.

0rbit enables Access to ANY Real-World data present and accessible across internet into your `ao` process.

0rbit provides the following features to get access to the data using the HTTP protocol:

- [**Fetch HTTP Data**](https://docs.0rbit.co/developer/get-request): A handler to make a HTTP Get Request from your `ao` process to the web.
- [**Post HTTP Data**](https://docs.0rbit.co/developer/post-request): A handler to make a HTTP Post Request from your `ao` process to the web.
