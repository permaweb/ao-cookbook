# AOS: AO Operating System

AOS is a powerful operating system built on top of the AO hyper-parallel computer. While AO provides the distributed compute infrastructure, AOS offers a simplified interface for interacting with and developing processes in this environment.

## What is AOS?

AOS enables you to:

- Create and interact with processes on the AO network
- Develop distributed applications using a simple, intuitive approach
- Leverage the Lua programming language for deterministic, reliable operations

All you need to get started is a terminal and a code editor. AOS uses [Lua](../../concepts/lua.md) as its primary language - a robust, deterministic, and user-friendly programming language that's ideal for distributed applications.

> **New to AO?** If you're just getting started, we recommend completing our [tutorials](../../tutorials/index) first. They take just 15-30 minutes and provide an excellent foundation.

## Getting Started with AOS
