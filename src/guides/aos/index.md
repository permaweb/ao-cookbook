# aos

While `ao` is a hyper parallel computer that enables distributed compute, `aos` is an operating system on top of that computer.

With `aos` you can interact with processes and you can code processes in a very simple and intuitive way. All you need is a terminal and an editor.

The language chosen for `aos` is [lua](../../concepts/lua.md), which is a robust and deterministic dynamic language that is a lot of fun to work with.

If you haven't done so yet, take 15-30 minutes and go through our [tutorials](../../tutorials/index).
