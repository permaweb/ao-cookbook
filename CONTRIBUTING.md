# Contributing to the Cookbook

👍🎉First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines on how to contribute

## What should I know before I get started?

### a Cookbook Layout

The cookbook is layed out in 4 different sections.

| Section         | Description                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Getting Started | Resources for starting development on ao                    |
| Core Concepts   | Building blocks of ao that are good to know for development |
| Guides          | Snack-sized guides about different tools for development    |
| References      | References to commonly needed code snippets                 |

Depending on what you are writing, it will live in one of these sections

#### References

References are an overarching topic with a list of references of how to do
things under that topic. The general structure is the following:

```
Code Reference Title

Short Summary (Include why to use this ref)

Code Snippet
```

#### Guides

Guides are longer form informational documentation on various topics.
The general structure for writing a guide is the following:

```
Brief Summary/TLDR

Why should I use this guide

Fact Sheet

Deep Dive

Other Resources
```

### Building
